# TinNews: An Android App for News, served in a Tinder-like fashion

## Description

In this project, I designed and developed an android application to collect news from [News API](https://newsapi.org), and served it up to users in a Tinder-like UI. Used the Room Database to support local cache and offer offline usage.

TinNews allows users to easily navigate to articles they might be interested in, through left and right swiping, and saves their "liked" articles for them to read later, with additional functionality to search through all news stories available.
